  {
    "question": "What object.freeze() does?",
    "answer": "The Object.freeze() method is used to freeze an object. Freezing an object does not allow new properties to be added to the object and prevents removing or altering the existing properties. Object.freeze() preserves the enumerability, configurability, writability, and prototype of the object. It returns the passed object and does not create a frozen copy.",
    "tag": "javascript"
  },
  {
    "question": "Explain the difference between Object.freeze() vs const.",
    "answer": "The const keyword creates a read-only reference to a value. Variables created by the const keyword are immutable. In other words, you can’t reassign them to different values. Trying to reassign a constant variable will result in a TypeError. If you want the value of the person object to be immutable, you have to freeze it by using the Object.freeze() method.",

  },
  {
    "question": " What is JSX?",
    "answer": "JSX is a language that React uses to embed an HTML template in code. It is nott understood by browsers and must be transpiled with tools like webpack and Babel before it can be run.Still, JSX helps streamline React development once you know its syntax. You dont actually have to use JSX to create React components and can use React.createElement() instead, but Facebook recommends using JSX. Most React developers prefer its declarative syntax, and it also reduces code complexity.",
    "tag": "react"
  },

  {
    "question": " What components are stateless in React?",
    "answer": "While most components in React have a state, stateless components are those reusable functions implemented to render DOM based on the provided existing properties. This does not need an internal state because in output, it is nothing more than a pure function compiled of properties.",
    "tag": "react"
  },

  {
    "question": "Can browsers read JSX code?",
    "answer": "Usually browsers only read JavaScript objects. We have to use a JavaScript compiler such as Babel to convert JSX into .js files before passing it to the browser. However, there is a way to use JSX directly in modern browsers by running the Babel standalone script. The only drawback is that it adds extra loading and compilation steps at runtime, which reduces the performance of your website.",
    "tag": "react"
  },

  {
    "question": "Define an event in the context of React?",
    "answer": "In React, events refer to triggered reactions to specific user actions such as a key press, mouse click or mouse hover. Dealing with these events is the same as dealing with DOM elements events. However, there are some syntactic differences. One is that the React events are named using the camel case rather than the lowercase. Another one is that the React events are passed as functions in curly brackets instead of string values.",
